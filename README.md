# BrainLeak
You forgot something in the basement... now is not the time to forget!

## Gameplay

You are stupid, and your eyes are stupid. With these facts on the table you must now collect something in the basement, this might sound simple, but it's a goddamn maze and your vision is blurred - it's mostly just 1bit vision, so you are pretty fucked. You have to remember where you are and where you have been, draing a map in your mind - so watch out for brain leaks. Oh, and another problem is that your water pipe is leaking so you might drown - hurry up!

## Controls
